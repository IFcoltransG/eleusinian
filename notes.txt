AFFAIR

EMBEZZLEMENT
Raven was dying, so wanted money for kids

Flaherty was involved

Maybe it was a suicide? A frame job? Kiran framing someone?

Only information you get about the police is from a police interview. The interviewee keeps asking them questions. Celes?
	Celes thinks Kiran did it, and tries to protect them.

Left to do:
arrange meeting with Lars or Flaherty; maybe draft a message to Peyton saying I know everything, and that I've sent it all to Flaherty (i.e. whoever was in charge of the embezzlement case).
--talk to Peyton
Ruska could be peoplewatching
--let the audience get to know everyone better

Things left I might consider doing.
	Drop another hint or two that Pat and Flaherty are working together.
	Drop another hint or two the Flaherty is corrupt
	Drop another hint or two that Kiran went to see Flaherty
