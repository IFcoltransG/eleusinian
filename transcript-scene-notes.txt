Evidence against whomever
Irrelevant questions?
Prepared speech, matter of fact
Assertions for direct confrontation
When the subject has time to elocute, they have power. The confident one makes jokes.
Questions versus elocution is a good dynamic.
Someone can get pissed off.
Playing with the record
Reviewing what's been said.
Changing the stakes. Re-changing them at the last moment.
Being a friend who just needs to get through this interrogation with you.
Confidence, friendliness, just wanting the truth in conversation.

Summary confrontation
Pieces of evidence: "I get why you did it", interrupting denials, refuting objections
"We're on your side" confronting but familiar, looking for signs of weakness
Two possible reasons for why

Initial conditions:
Celes believes (will believe) that Kiran did any embezzling
Flaherty is in on corruption (that Peyton Sanchez payed them off (to kill Raven and to cover it up???)) [why? Peyton gave Flaherty confidential information]
Flaherty and Lars know evidence that suggests Celes is in dire financial straights and could have had opportunity to maybe embezzle [how?]
They also know that Raven was found dead () [how? something non-murderous]

Celes learns that embezzling happened
Celes learns anything about Raven's death???
Celes learns that Flaherty has information that there was no legitimate way to get hold of, and got it from Peyton
Celes learns that Flaherty has cut some deal with Peyton

Flaherty learns that
Lars learns to be suspicious of Flaherty

Audience learns that Flaherty and Peyton are working together
Audience learns that police don't think this has anything to do with Raven's death
Audience wonders what Flaherty and Peyton are up to
Audience wonders whether Lars is in on it
Audience learns that Peyton was watching emails(?)

What do I need to remove: Marsick did not get killed by anyone

Flow:
Starts out with detectives having upper hand, but each step forward, Celes gets something out of them.
  After establishing the situation briefly, Celes pretends to be lost.
  A series of questions, then repeating the important one when they try to brush them off.
In response to 'I don't have that information', Celes says "get that other cop in here, the one that looked competent" "Lars?" "I thought you were lars?" "I'm Flaherty"
Eventually Celes shuts them down.
"You aren't the brightest." wasting my time, I know you're incompetent or wilfully negligent. If you continue going after me or who I care about, you'll find yourself in the same place you started. On the other side of a table with me. (?)
Lawyer.

Interruptions show balance of power.
When the subject has time to elocute, they have power. The confident one makes jokes.
