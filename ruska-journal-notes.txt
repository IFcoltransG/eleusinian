Plan:
====
Channelling Samatar badly.
Starts with calm epistolary about memories. There's a surreal description, slightly off from reality.
It might be a strange land.
Questions to the self.
Ends with grieving, disjointed: there is no immediate resolution in sight, just a missingness.
Final line is a semantic surprise, something that *feels* like a change from the rest of the story.
Gleaned from Monster Portraits interview:
What sights makes me saddest? Which touches?
In writing, you mustn't be afraid of going to far. Or, you must be afraid, and seek out that fear. Let go.
If you feel it slipping one way, don't rein it in. React! Rebuff it wildly!
