no no no not silly. see the stories we tell ourselves, doesn't matter what they are, if you believe it, then it becomes true for you.
when I was small my uncle would tell me about the soul. and when he passed on I needed to know he would stick around, I knew his karma would give him a good life. so he wasn't gone, because I felt he was still around somewhere if that makes any sense

fine, maybe a little silly but that's what makes you you.
