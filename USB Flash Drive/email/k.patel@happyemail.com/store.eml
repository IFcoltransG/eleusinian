cancer is me. according to the horoscope, 'passion ignites in my heart'. now, if I remember, your birthday is the end of november, which is sagittarius according to this web site. 'you may be feeling especially introspective'

no no no not silly. see the stories we tell ourselves, doesn't matter what they are, if you believe it, then it becomes true for you.
when I was small my uncle would tell me about the soul. and when he passed on I needed to know he would stick around, I knew his karma would give him a good life. so he wasn't gone, because I felt he was still around somewhere if that makes any sense

fine, maybe a little silly but that's what makes you you.
