Hi Hon,

How are things at work? Did the ritual succeed? You'll have to tell me all about it when I'm back in town.

They need me a few extra days in New York, so I'll be back next week on the 7th. We could need to move date night to Thursday, as I will be off again on the Saturday to The Netherlands.

Love,
Krishna

Hi Hon,

I called you just now (6:30) but you didn't answer. I wanted to tell you about the airport. You'll never guess who I saw! I was arguing with a bodyguard about something, and I was doing that gesture to make a point. You know the one where I flick my head dismissively, which you said no one else could do the same, and happened to lock eyes with someone in Departures. It was Peyton Sanchez, from your work!

Peyton says hello. (Also to to tell you how much Peyton was impressed by Ruska Keating and Marsick's collaboration. I'm sure you know whoever they are.) You can bet I'll quiz you about the juicy details this time tomorrow morning when I get back into Cairo!

I miss you,
Krishna

cancer is me. according to the horoscope, 'passion ignites in my heart'. now, if I remember, your birthday is the end of november, which is sagittarius according to this web site. 'you may be feeling especially introspective'

no no no not silly. see the stories we tell ourselves, doesn't matter what they are, if you believe it, then it becomes true for you.
when I was small my uncle would tell me about the soul. and when he passed on I needed to know he would stick around, I knew his karma would give him a good life. so he wasn't gone, because I felt he was still around somewhere if that makes any sense

fine, maybe a little silly but that's what makes you you.

Hi Honey,

That memory stick I borrowed, security insisted that they scan it for viruses. They said they found some "encrypted files." Do you know what they are? I told them it was probably for your work, but I thought I would ask in case it was a virus.

Love you,
Krishna

don't worry krishna, those are just temporary backups
the work servers have been on the fritz lately, they corrupted every date in the e-mail system last month. I've been storing things on the flash drive in case it goes wrong again
