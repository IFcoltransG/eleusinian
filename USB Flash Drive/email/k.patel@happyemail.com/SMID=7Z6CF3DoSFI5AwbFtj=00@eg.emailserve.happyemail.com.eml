Hi Hon,

How are things at work? Did the ritual succeed? You'll have to tell me all about it when I'm back in town.

They need me a few extra days in New York, so I'll be back next week on the 7th. We could need to move date night to Thursday, as I will be off again on the Saturday to The Netherlands.

Love,
Krishna
