Hi Hon,

I called you just now (6:30) but you didn't answer. I wanted to tell you about the airport. You'll never guess who I saw! I was arguing with a bodyguard about something, and I was doing that gesture to make a point. You know the one where I flick my head dismissively, which you said no one else could do the same, and happened to lock eyes with someone in Departures talking with a police officer. It was Peyton Sanchez, from your work!

Peyton says hello. (Also to to tell you how much Peyton was impressed by Ruska Keating and Marsick's collaboration. I'm sure you know whoever they are.) You can bet I'll quiz you about the juicy details this time tomorrow morning when I get back into Cairo!

I miss you,
Krishna
