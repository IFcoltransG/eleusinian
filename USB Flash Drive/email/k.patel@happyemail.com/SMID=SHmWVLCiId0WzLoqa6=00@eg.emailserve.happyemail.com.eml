Hi Hon,

I called you just now (6:30) but you didn't answer. I wanted to tell you about the airport. You'll never guess who I saw! My bodyguards had lost my lunch, so we were hunting for a brown paper bag, and I saw a traveller giving one to a police officer. We rushed over to prevent a serious miscarriage of justice and retrieve my lunch. It wasn't my food that had been turned in as evidence luckily, but the traveller was Peyton Sanchez, from your work! We met at your 'turning in a profit' celebration. Your boss is a good citizen.

Peyton says hello. (Also to to tell you just how much Peyton was impressed by Ruska Keating and Marsick's collaboration. I'm sure you know whoever they are.) You can bet I'll quiz you about the juicy details this time tomorrow morning when I get back into Cairo!

I miss you,
Krishna
