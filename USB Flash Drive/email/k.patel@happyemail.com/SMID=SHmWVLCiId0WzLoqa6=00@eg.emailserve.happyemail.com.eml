Hi Hon,

I called you just now (6:30) but you didn't answer. I wanted to tell you about the airport. You'll never guess who I saw! My bodyguards had lost my breakfast and you know how I am with airline food. So they were hunting for a brown doggy bag, and I saw a traveller giving one to a police officer. We rushed over to prevent a serious miscarriage of justice and retrieve my meal. We didn't find my breakfast, but as luck would have it the traveller was Peyton Sanchez, from your work! We met a while ago at your 'turning in a profit' celebration. Your boss must be a good citizen.

Peyton says hello. (Also to tell you just how much Peyton was impressed by Ruska Keating and Marsick's collaboration. I'm sure you know whoever they are.) You can bet I'll quiz you about the juicy details this time tomorrow morning when I get back into Cairo!

I miss you,
Krishna
