don't worry about it, I filled them in for you
maybe next time you could file them as you go, instead, to smooth this process

A fine morning to you Kiran!

Say, I was taking a gander through the completed balance sheet, and, well. I just can't get my head around it. I am confident this is all some misunderstanding on my part, but the numbers don't add up spick. Perchance I could pop on down to discuss the accounts?

Yes, woe betide we don't keep the boss abreast, but of course we need not disturb old Pat off in Jerusalem. The runnings of the company rest in our hands, eh friend?

Cheerio,
         Ray

P.S. Avoid Paris today.

Hello Kiran,
The work is the same but I am not the same.
Raven was a friend. A friend to all, but all the same, Raven was a friend.
I feel deeply missing. I need some time.
Best wishes,
Ruska

Dear Kiran,

It seems likely that I would be able to fill and file your expense sheets if I had <i>any</i> moment to spare. I wonder. <i>What actions</i> might we all be able to do, to help me with that? To help “smooth processes” as you say? I don't know, perhaps we could <b>refrain</b> from compromising the physical security of our company by leaving the building unattended and unlocked. Would that be a possibility, or are you going to keep letting malignant presences traipse through our work in every possible world! I don't know if you realise (in spite of my reminders) that your actions have consequences. I don't mind, only when that consequence is a breakin that destroys some 4000 <i>worth of supplies</i>. <b>YOUR</b> actions. Shit, there are your expenses. I'm here frantic with the repairs, damn it, I don't have time for you. For your expenses.
Plus we have no administrator. I know I shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but it was FUCKING inconsiderate for Marsick to keel over now. Can you cut me some fucking slack?

Cordially,
Paris

Dear Kiran,

In my last email some of my phrasing could have been construed as <i>standoffish</i> or <i>unhappy</i>. I only meant to suggest that some decisions have lead us to the situation we are in. Science is dangerous. We'll talk later about mandatory security protocol.

See you soon,
Paris

I'm sure the empty role of director of admin has crossed your mind. If we're going to put out the fires and move on with the vision, that's our first step.

Good you're filling in the role in the interim. Thoughts about Ruska Keating taking it permanently, after this all blows over? Keating's flighty now, but everything else I've seen says capable. Especially Morocco. Hell, if we didn't have a co like you, I'd give Keating that!

Shaw could take acquisitions or, we'll see.
