A fine morning to you Kiran!

Say, I was taking a gander through the completed balance sheet, and, well. I just can't get my head around it. I am confident this is all some misunderstanding on my part, but the numbers don't add up spick. Perchance I could pop on down to discuss the accounts?

Yes, woe betide we don't keep the boss abreast, but of course we need not disturb old Pat off in Jerusalem. The runnings of the company rest in our hands, eh friend?

Cheerio,
         Ray

P.S. Avoid Paris today.
