Dear Kiran,

It seems likely that I would be able to fill and file your expense sheets if I had <i>any</i> moment to spare. I wonder. <i>What actions</i> might we all be able to do, to help me with that? To help “smooth processes” as you say? I don't know, perhaps we could <b>refrain</b> from compromising the physical security of our company by leaving the building unattended and unlocked. Would that be a possibility, or are you going to keep letting malignant presences traipse through our work in every possible world! I don't know if you realise (in spite of my reminders) that your actions have consequences. I don't mind, only when that consequence is a breakin that destroys some 4000 <i>worth of supplies</i>. <b>YOUR</b> actions. Shit, there are your expenses. I'm here frantic with the repairs, damn it, I don't have time for you. For your expenses.
Plus we have no administrator. I know I shouldn't speak ill of the dead, but it was FUCKING inconsiderate for Marsick to keel over now. Can you cut me some fucking slack?

Cordially,
Paris
