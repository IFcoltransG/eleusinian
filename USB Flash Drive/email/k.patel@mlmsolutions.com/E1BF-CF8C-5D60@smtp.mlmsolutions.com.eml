I'm sure the empty role of director of admin has crossed your mind. If we're going to put out the fires and move on with the vision, that's our first step.

Good you're filling in the role in the interim. Thoughts about Ruska Keating taking it permanently, after this all blows over? Keating's flighty now, but everything else I've seen says capable. Especially Morocco. Hell, if we didn't have a co like you, I'd give Keating that!

Shaw could take acquisitions or, we'll see.
