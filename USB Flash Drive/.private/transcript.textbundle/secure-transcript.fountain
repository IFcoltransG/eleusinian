INT. STATION INTERVIEW ROOM 1

Interviewer FLAHERTY Detective Inspector Baas Flaherty A403, investigating C3481.
Interviewee DAGOSTINO Celes D'Agostino, taken in for questioning re C3481.


FLAHERTY
--on. For the recording, I am DI Flaherty interviewing...

DAGOSTINO
Celes.

FLAHERTY
Celes D'Agostino. Today is the February 17th. The time is 1036.

DAGOSTINO
It's, uh, cold in here.

FLAHERTY
Would you like me to change the thermostat?

DAGOSTINO
No. No.

FLAHERTY
Let's get into it. Celes, I'm investigating your company MLM Solutions. It appears that over the past quarter, MLM Solutions has lost--misplaced--a sum of money. I mean that someone has removed money from the company accounts that they shouldn't have. Celes--

DAGOSTINO
I don't--

FLAHERTY
Me and my team have been hard at work gathering a variety of information about the disappearance. We know roughly when the money was taken, and we have a good idea of how. I'm here to ask you some questions, to figure out just what happened and why. Now, if there's a question that you don't want to answer, you don't have to answer it, I don't want you to feel pressured to answer. We're all only doing our best to figure out why that money went missing. Do you understand what I'm saying?

DAGOSTINO
I understand, yes.

FLAHERTY
How long have you been working at MLM Solutions?

DAGOSTINO
Um, how am I related to all this, officer?

FLAHERTY
Fine. I'll move on to the evidence. As I was saying, we were recently informed of a discrepancy in the bookkeeping at MLM Solutions, and have identified that some of the money is not accounted for. The money could be missing for any number of reasons, but the most likely is that an employee took it. This sort of thing happens. We all gotta do bad things to feed our family sometimes. *[small sigh]* Celes, we've looked at your financial records. You need money, and you need it dangerously.

DAGOSTINO
I don't know any--

FLAHERTY
I just want to get some answers.

DAGOSTINO ^
I'm not *[inaudible]*

FLAHERTY
Hey, hey, look, look at me. I just want some answers.

DAGOSTINO
I'm in a bad financial situation? Yes, I'm still in it. You think I'd still be in debt if was a traditor to my honor? No, no. Never would I. I know nothing about this.

FLAHERTY
It's fine if you don't want to say anything, but I can ask the rest of the company. The truth is going to come out eventually. Now, as an executive at MLM Solutions, er, it says here 'director of business innovation', you would have access to the company finances.

DAGOSTINO
_What?_ No access, the only ones who ran all of that side of things is Sanchez, Peyton Sanchez, and ... and Kiran.

FLAHERTY
And Kiran? Ah yes, you mean Kiran Patel. Interesting. Very--

DAGOSTINO
Oh, and Marsick. God grant rest the hallowed. Marsick certainly would have been able to... before, ah. Did Marsick...

FLAHERTY
Did Marsick...?

DAGOSTINO
Was Marsick... Did Marsick's death have something to do with this?

FLAHERTY
At this stage of the investigation we have no reason to believe that Marsick's death was anything other than, uh, trouble with the heart. Ah, but speaking of hearts getting us into trouble *[laugh]* it appears that Kiran Patel and yourself have been exchanging some, sensitive emails. Not what I'd expect from professional colleagues. I can read them out if you'd like. “never!”...

DAGOSTINO
What right have-- Where did you get those? You looked at my private-- what does Kiran have anything to do with this? Who, who gave you the emails?

FLAHERTY
For the integrity of our investigation my source will need to stay anonymous.

DAGOSTINO
Not myself, it wouldn't be Kiran... Sanchez! It must be have been Sanchez gave you access to my emails.

FLAHERTY
Celes, your relationship to Kiran, who had access to the account... It looks to me like you had motive, and opportunity to make that money to go missing. Now, there are any number of reasons you didn't want to tell anyone. Good reasons, for love, for fear, or possibly not so savory. Greed. I want to believe the best in you Celes, that you did it for noble, for honorable reasons. But right now, I want even more to get the truth. So which is it? How come the money is gone?

DAGOSTINO
I didn't--

FLAHERTY
_Why_ did you take the money?

DAGOSTINO
What is this money? I know nothing, how much was there? Why did Sanchez give you my emails with Kiran? Where did the money come from before? Why didn't Sanchez tell you I have no access to company accounts?

FLAHERTY
Hey now, why don't we keep going with the interview so we can figure out what happened and we can both go home, yes?

DAGOSTINO
Why. Why did Peyton Sanchez give you our emails?

FLAHERTY
We required access to those emails for the case.

DAGOSTINO
So it _was_ Sanchez. What were you even trying to find? Aside whether it's even legal to...

FLAHERTY
Ah, this is not my area. It's not important to the case. We--

DAGOSTINO
If you don't know? Then get that other cop, the one that _did_ look competent, in here.

FLAHERTY
You meaning DI Lars?

DAGOSTINO
I thought you were Lars.

FLAHERTY
I'm Flaherty.

DAGOSTINO
Flaherty. Lars. Get me someone who isn't an idiot.

FLAHERTY
I... Stay here.

The door is heard opening. For a few seconds a sharp beep. Then shutting again.

Co-interviewer LARS Detective Inspector Pip Lars A203, off-duty.

LARS
Flaherty. D'Agostino. Can I help?

FLAHERTY
Lars, this is Celes, interviewing about--

LARS
We've met. Celes, can I call you Celes?

A short pause.

DAGOSTINO
Lars, how did you get your grubby hands on my emails with Kiran Patel?

LARS
That was Flaherty's area. What _I_ want to know is, are you in love with Patel?

DAGOSTINO
That's-- What I want to know is, are you in love with Detective Inspector Flaherty?

LARS
I don't follow.

FLAHERTY ^
What?

DAGOSTINO
For the recording: DI Lars is blushing.

LARS
For the recording, I am not blushing.

DAGOSTINO
*[long breath in]* Why are you so anxious to finish this case?

LARS
I'm sorry?

DAGOSTINO
This interrogation--the illegal stealing of my emails--did you know about it?

FLAHERTY
Hold on! This is--

LARS
Detective Inspector Flaherty.

FLAHERTY
What you're insinuating...

LARS
Are you done, Flaherty? Celes, I have no answer to offer about your question. To the best of my knowledge, we have approached this case with _all_ due rigour and protocol.

DAGOSTINO
You're lying! There's something off with this case.

LARS
If there's any misconduct, I assure you I will look into the matter.

DAGOSTINO
That is meaningless. *[sigh]* Cards on the table. You are both too stupid to be worth any of my time. I know that you're both either incompetent or intentionally negligents. I don't care what you look into. I don't care whether your superiors find out what you've done. I just care, here's what's going to happen. You are going to delete all confidential files you illegally stole. You will stop hounding me, and you will stop hounding the people I love. If you would like to interrogate someone, you'll interrogate my lawyer. Do you understand what I'm saying?

FLAHERTY
Hang on, D'Agostino!

LARS
This interview has terminated at 10:49 am on the...

A door opens.

LARS (CONT'D)
...17th of February 2009.

Recording ends.
