Goodbye Kiran,

You screwed up. Have the files you asked for, but now we're done. You had your chance to fix this. You don't get to use me again and I don't want to forgive you.

I'm out of town another week. I'll come by the house on the 2nd to collect my belongings. Then I'm not coming back. I hope your new life is everything you deserve.

Enjoy it while it lasts,
Krishna
