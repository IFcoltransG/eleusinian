Good morning Lars,


The higher-ups want the Kiran Patel case wrapped up quickly. Flaherty’s team is busy. I need you on it.

The deceased’s spouse, Krishna Patel, found the body in their shared home on the morning of the 2nd. There was no sign of a break in.

A USB flash drive was found on the body, which we believe was in Kiran Patel’s possession at time of death. Its contents are attached.

The coroner reports that the deceased died of blood loss, 36 to 48 hours before discovery. Krishna Patel claims to have been in the air during that interval, although we are still waiting for confirmation from the Cairo International Airport. Patel was stabbed three times in the back. Patel received three dorsal thoracic stab wounds.


Best of luck,
D.I. Said
