This is a murder-mystery game. It was created for a competition, accounting for the odd format. The name comes from the fact it's a mystery.

## Installation
Run `build.sh` to compile `game.shar`, if compile is the right word. Then run `game.shar` to start the game.
If you have the skills to install the dependencies for `game.shar`, you probably have the tech skills needed to finish the game. If not, you probably don't.
